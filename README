Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded
Linux systems through cross-compilation.

The documentation can be found in docs/manual. You can generate a text
document with 'make manual-text' and read output/docs/manual/manual.text.
Online documentation can be found at http://buildroot.org/docs.html

To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:

1) run 'make menuconfig'
2) select the target architecture and the packages you wish to compile
3) run 'make'
4) wait while it compiles
5) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images

You do not need to be root to build or run buildroot.  Have fun!

Buildroot comes with a basic configuration for a number of boards. Run
'make list-defconfigs' to view the list of provided configurations.

# NUVOTON MA35D1 SERIES RELATED DESCRIPTION:
============================================

The following boards were test in this release:

	- nuvoton_ma35d1_evb_defconfig
	- nuvoton_ma35d1_iot_defconfig
	- nuvoton_ma35d1_som_defconfig

After the complilatiobn is complete, you can get the complete image in
"output/images" folder

SD card image provides the full system to boot with TFA, u-Boot, Kernel and file system,
do the following:
1) run 'make nuvoton_ma35d1_evb_defconfig'
2) run 'make menuconfig'
3) modify 'Bootloaders ---> Board defconfig' to 'ma35d1_sdcard0' or 'ma35d1_sdcard1'
4) run 'make arm-trusted-firmware-dirclean uboot-dirclean linux-dirclean'
5) run 'make'
6) wait while it compiles
7) find pack-core-image-buildroot-ma35d1-evb-sdcard.bin and
        core-image-buildroot-ma35d1-evb.rootfs.sdcard in output/images

Run the following command to write SD card image.
Change sdx below to match the one used by the SD card.

sudo dd if=core-image-buildroot-ma35d1-evb.rootfs.sdcard of=/dev/sdx conv=fsync

SPINAND image provides the full system to boot with TFA, u-Boot, Kernel and file system,
do the following:
1) run 'make nuvoton_ma35d1_evb_defconfig'
2) run 'make menuconfig'
3) modify 'Bootloaders ---> Board defconfig' to 'ma35d1_spinand'
4) run 'make arm-trusted-firmware-dirclean uboot-dirclean linux-dirclean'
5) run 'make'
6) wait while it compiles
7) find pack-core-image-buildroot-ma35d1-evb-spinand.bin in output/images

NAND image provides the full system to boot with TFA, u-Boot, Kernel and file system,
do the following:
1) run 'make nuvoton_ma35d1_evb_defconfig'
2) run 'make menuconfig'
3) modify 'Bootloaders ---> Board defconfig' to 'ma35d1_nand'
4) run 'make arm-trusted-firmware-dirclean uboot-dirclean linux-dirclean'
        if you use optee-os, you need to run 'make optee-os-dirclean'
5) run 'make'
6) wait while it compiles
7) find pack-core-image-buildroot-ma35d1-evb-nand.bin in output/images

NOTE: pack-core-image-buildroot-#####.bin can be used by the MA35D1 nuwriter tool
